# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

Description: This project was created to give you an insight on my background education, work experience and something about me. This project challenged me to create a user-friendly page where you are able to learn more about me. It allowed me to put the words, functions, codes, and style into action. It allowed me to execute all types of resources (videos, and website that I might encounter on a daily basis.

## Installation

There are no requirements for installation for this project. All that is needed to be done is open the page in a desired web browser.


## Usage

When you open the website you should be provided with my name displayed on the initial page. Clicking the headers at the top allows user to skip directly to the section they want to know more about. Scrolling down allows the user to view my portfolio from top to bottom. Clicking on the images in the project section will directly take you to my GitHub containing that repository. The links at the bottom will directly take you to my GitHub, allow you to call me by directly clicking my phone number and email me by clicking my email.
